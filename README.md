# Cool Experiments & Stuff

## What is this repo?
This repository, as the name says, contains experiments or any other stuff that I don't think is important enough to deserve its own repository but I still think is cool enough to be shared with others. Most of these projects are either useless, a re-creation of something already done or I just don't intend to complete them, often a combination of these 3 things. As such, expect un-optimized code, missing documentation and buggy code.
