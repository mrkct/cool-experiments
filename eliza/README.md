# Eliza: the computerized psychotherapist
## What is this
This is an implementation of the [1966 chatbot ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). 
ELIZA, with her most famous script DOCTOR, was supposed to be a parody of a psychotherapist, 
repeating back to the patient what he said. Nonetheless it makes for some pretty realistic conversations, 
until you realize she basically just repeating what you said back to you.

This implementation is not as complex as the original one, but it's still fun.
## How to run it
Just run `eliza.py` and start writing to her

    python eliza.py

To quit use CTRL-C - ENTER

## Notes
- The patterns are taken from the implementations here: https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen
